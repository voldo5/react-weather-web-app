### Immer
useImmer(initialState) is very similar to useState. When passing a function to the updater, the draft argument can be mutated freely, until the producer ends and the changes will be made immutable and become the next state.

### React DnD
React DnD is a set of React utilities to help you build complex drag and drop interfaces while keeping your components decoupled.
